To my fellow work-from-home employees,


I've been working remotely for Rackspace for over a year now. It's an awesome
gig. However, it's not without it's challenges. Today, I'd like to discuss
communication channels and their priorities. *Boring*, I know; But, I think you
might learn something.


This week, I dare you to live by the mantra 'outsource yourself'. Why? Not because
you think someone will take your job in an offshore developing nation. No!
Definitely not that. Because if you outsource yourself, then you can go on to
doing more specialized tasks, deeper into the vast unknown of interesting
problems.


Amir's Hierarchy of Interruptions
`````````````````````````````````
1. In-person meeting
    a. meeting room
    b. at-desk/hallway interruption (scheduled vs interruption)
2. Video conference meeting
    a. Google Hangouts
    b. Lifesize ClearSea
    c. Vidyo
3. Voice conference meeting
    a. Teamspeak
    b. phone
4. Text conference (IRC)
    a. scheduled meeting
    b. instant message/random dialogue
5. E-mail
    a. Inter-office
    b. Intra-office
    c. Personal
6. Bug tracking tickets
    a. Company-related
    b. Open source-related
7. Wiki document, internal Q&A
    a. Wikipedia or Atlassian Confluence
    b. Stack Overflow, Askbot
8. Full-blown documentation
    a. Customer facing
    b. Internal

Don't get me wrong. There are times when each step is necessary and relevant,
but I think we end up in the top of the hierarchy much too often than we should,
the more we can slide toward location independent and time independent methods
we can achieve more productivity, in my humble opinion.


Here's my challenge to you. Measure how much time you spend in each of the
levels of the hierarchy over the next week. If you have the patience, track how
much of each level is scheduled versus interrupted (unscheduled).
